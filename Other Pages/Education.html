    <p>I studied games design at UAL from 2016 and achieved my Bachelors with honors in 2019. <br />
    I loved my time at university! I moved away from a small countryside town in the Northwest to the big city of London and found it incredibly thrilling! I would love to go back and do my masters degree at some point in the future.
